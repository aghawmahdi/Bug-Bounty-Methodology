# ðŸ¦¾ Methodology Flow

**Reconnaissance**

* Technologies and CMS
* Assets

**Enumeration & Scanning**

* Asset â†’ FLinks â†’ HTTPX â†’ Nuclei (Open Redirect)
* Asset â†’ HTTPX â†’ CORS Misconfiguration
* Assets â†’ Backup Fuzzer â†’ Information Disclosure
* Assets â†’ FLinks â†’ HTTPx â†’ XSS Detector
* Fuzzing on various properties

**Vulnerability Identification**

* Abusing Reverse Proxies
* Cache Vulnerabilities
* Cross-Site Request Forgery
* Cross-Site Scripting
* Ephemeral Vulnerabilities
* HTTP Request Smuggling
* Injection SQL RCE
* Insecure Indirect Object Reference (IDOR)
* Mass Assignment
* Open Redirect
* Race Condition
* Same Pattern Vulnerability
* SSRF Discovery and Post Exploitation
* Assets + MEG + GF â†’ Vulnerability (This likely refers to exploiting a combination of findings using different tools like MEG, GF, etc.)

**Reporting**

* Vulnerability Discovery
* (This step assumes reported vulnerabilities are documented and submitted following the program's guidelines)
